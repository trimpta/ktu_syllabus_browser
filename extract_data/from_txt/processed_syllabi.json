Compare theoretical results with empirical data using different partitioning algorithms such as Spectral Clustering - Uses the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix, K-means Clustering - Applied to spectral embeddings of the graph, Normalized Cut - Minimizes the normalized cut criterion. Measure how close the empirical conductance is to the theoretical lower bound provided by Cheeger's inequality.
