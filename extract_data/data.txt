Suggestion on Project Topics
Students may identify a real life problem that can be solved using the concepts of machine learning. They
may either use a standard dataset or build their own, for the purpose of applying machine learning
algorithms. Besides, they may make use of various evaluation parameters to measure the efficiency of the
methods. A few sample questions are given below.
1. Classification of Handwritten Digits: Classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset
using various machine learning algorithms and compare their performance. This will involve pre-
processing the data, applying different classification techniques and using ensemble methods to
improve accuracy.
2. Predicting Student Examination Performance Based on Internal Marks: Develop a real life
dataset using the historical data of your institution. Use various machine learning algorithms to
build models to predict students’ final examination scores based on their internal assessment
marks and evaluate their performance. Use ensemble methods to improve accuracy of prediction.
Also, segment the students using clustering techniques to identify potential students at academic
risk so that the educators can make timely interventions.

FireBase, MongoDB etc. (for NoSQL databases). The UI part (if applicable) may be developed using
any programming language such as JAVA or Python. A few sample project topics are given below.
1. Design and implement a normalized database schema for the following requirement.
A library wants to maintain the record of books, members, book issue, book return, and fines
collected for late returns, in a database. The database can be loaded with book information.
Students can register with the library to be a member. Books can be issued to students with a valid
library membership. A student can keep an issued book with him/her for a maximum period of two
weeks from the date of issue, beyond which a fine will be charged. Fine is calculated based on the
delay in days of return. For 0-7 days: Rs 10, For 7 – 30 days: Rs 100, and for days above 30 days:
Rs 10 will be charged per day.

Course Objectives:
1. To familiarize various Linux commands related to Operating systems.
2. To give practical experience for learners on implementing different functions of Operating
systems such as process management, memory management, and disk management.
Expt.
No. Experiments
1 Familiarisation with basic Linux programming commands: ps, strace, gdb, strings,
objdump, nm, file, od, xxd, time, fuser, top
2
Use /proc file system to gather basic information about your machine:
(a) Number of CPU cores
(b) Total memory and the fraction of free memory
(c) Number of processes currently running.
(d) Number of processes in the running and blocked states.
(e) Number of processes forked since the last bootup. How do you compare
this value with the one in (c) above?
(f) The number of context switches performed since the last bootup for a
particular process.
3
Write a simple program to print the system time and execute it. Then use the /proc file
system to determine how long this program (in the strict sense, the corresponding process)
ran in user and kernel modes.
4
Create a new process using a fork system call. Print the parent and child process IDs. Use
the pstree command to find the process tree for the child process starting from the init
process.
5
Write a program to add two integers (received via the command line) and compile it to an
executable named “myadder”. Now write another program that creates a new process using
a fork system call. Make the child process add two integers by replacing its image with the
“myadder” image using execvp system call.
6
Create a new process using a fork system call. The child process should print the string
“PCCSL407” and the parent process should print the string “Operating Systems Lab”.
Use a wait system call to ensure that the output displayed is “PCCSL407 Operating
Systems Lab”
7
Inter-process Communication (<https://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/lpg/node7.html>)
(a) Using Pipe – Evaluate the expression √𝑏ଶ − 4𝑎𝑐. The first process
evaluates 𝑏ଶ. The second process evaluates 4𝑎𝑐 and sends it to the first
process which evaluates the final expression and displays it.
(b) Using Message Queue - The first process sends a string to the second
process. The second process reverses the received string and sends it back
to the first process. The first process compares the original string and the
reversed string received from the second one and then prints whether the
string is a palindrome or not.
(c) Using Shared Memory - The first process sends three strings to the second
process. The second process concatenates them to a single string (with
whitespace being inserted between the two individual strings) and sends it
back to the first process. The first process prints the concatenated string in
the flipped case, that is if the concatenated string is “Hello S4 Students”,
the final output should be “hELLO s4 sTUDENTS”
8
Write a multithreaded program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation for
a list of integers. This program should receive a series of integers on the command line and
will then create three separate worker threads. The first thread will determine the mean
value, the second will determine the median and the third will calculate the standard
deviation of the integers. The variables representing the mean, median, and standard
deviation values will be stored globally. The worker threads will set these values, and the
parent thread will output the values once the workers have exited.
9
Input a list of processes, their CPU burst times (integral values), arrival times, and priorities.
Then simulate FCFS, SRTF, non-preemptive priority (a larger priority number implies a
higher priority), and RR (quantum = 3 units) scheduling algorithms on the process mix,
determining which algorithm results in the minimum average waiting time (over all
processes).
10 Use semaphores to solve the readers-writers problem with writers being given priority over
readers.
11 Obtain a (deadlock-free) process mix and simulate the banker’s algorithm to determine a
safe execution sequence.
12 Obtain a process mix and determine if the system is deadlocked.
13 Implement the deadlock-free semaphore-based solution for the dining philosopher’s
problem.
14
Simulate the address translation in the paging scheme as follows: The program receives
three command line arguments in the order
● size of the virtual address space (in megabytes)
● page size (in kilobytes)
● a virtual address (in decimal notation)
The output should be the physical address corresponding to the virtual address in <frame
number, offset> format. You may assume that the page table is implemented as an array
indexed by page numbers. (NB: If the page table has no index for the page number
determined from the virtual address, you may just declare a page table miss!)
15
Simulate the FIFO, LRU, and optimal page-replacement algorithms as follows: First,
generate a random page-reference string where page numbers range from 0 to 9. Apply the
random page-reference string to each algorithm, and record the number of page faults
incurred by each algorithm. Assume that demand paging is used. The length of the reference
string and the number of page frames (varying from 1 to 7) are to be received as command
line arguments.
16
Simulate the SSTF, LOOK, and CSCAN disk-scheduling algorithms as follows: Your
program will service a disk with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0 to 4,999. The program will
generate a random series of 10 cylinder requests and service them according to each of the
algorithms listed earlier. The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head (as
a parameter on the command line) and will report the total number of head movements
required by each algorithm.

2
Start your web browser and clear the browser's cache memory. Open Wireshark and start
capturing. Then visit any webpage of your choice. Type http in the filter field of the
Wireshark and click Apply so that only HTTP messages are displayed. After enough packets
have been captured, select the Capture from the pull-down menu and select Stop to stop
capturing.
Using the captured information, determine the following:
(a) the source IP address and destination IP address of the first GET message
(b) the medium format, the language, the encoding, and the character set that the
client can accept. (Use the first GET message)
(c) the URL of the website and the user agent (Use the first GET message)
(d) the source IP address and destination IP address of the first response message
(e) the status codes for the first response message.
(f) when the HTML file that you are retrieving was last modified at the server
(g) value of the content-length field of the first response message
(h) how long it took from the time the GET message was sent until the response
message was received.
(Use the timestamps of a GET message and that of the corresponding response
message. By default, the time column's value is the amount of time in seconds
since Wireshark tracing began.)
(i) the HTTP version of your browser.
3
Compose an e-mail and address it to yourself, but do not send it yet. Open the Wireshark
and start capturing. Go to your e-mail user agent and send the e-mail. In the Wireshark
window, type smtp in the filter field and click Apply. Stop capturing and save the captured
file.
Using the captured information, answer the following:
(a) All SMTP packets have the same two IP addresses. Which one is the IP address of
your computer? Which host does the other IP address represent?
(b) All SMTP packets have the same two port numbers. Which one is the port number
of the SMTP client process? In which range is the client port number?
(c) What is the port number of the SMTP server process?
(d) Examine the SMTP commands or SMTP response codes in each SMTP packet and
write down their meanings.
(e) There is an IMF packet that is encapsulated inside an SMTP packet. What is the
content of this packet?
4
First, clear the DNS record from the cache memory of your computer. For this, use
ipconfig/flushdns on Windows or systemd-resolve --flush-caches on Linux. Next, clear
your browser's cache memory. Open the Wireshark and start capturing. In your browser
visit your college website. Wireshark starts to capture packets. Type dns in the filter field
and press Apply so that only DNS messages are displayed. Stop capturing and save the
captured file.
Using the captured information, answer the following questions:
(a) Locate the first DNS query message resolving your college website. What is the
packet number (This “packet number” is assigned by Wireshark for listing purposes
only; it is NOT a packet number contained in any real packet header.) in the trace
for the DNS query message?
(b) Is this query message sent over UDP or TCP?
(c) Now locate the corresponding DNS response to the initial DNS query. What is the
packet number in the trace for the DNS response message? Is this response message
received via UDP or TCP?
(d) What are the source and destination port numbers for the DNS query message?
(e) What are the source and destination port numbers for the DNS response message?
(f) To what IP address is the DNS query message sent?
(g) What is the query message ID number? What is the response message ID number?
What is the purpose of this field?
(h) What is the length of the flag field in a DNS message?
(i) Which bit in the flag field determines whether the message is a query or a response?
(j) Which bits are used only in the response message? What is the function of these
bits in the response message?
(k) How many question records, answer records, authority records, and additional
records are present in the query message?
(l) How many question records, answer records, authority records, and additional
records are present in the response message?
Socket programming based
5
Client-Server communication using TCP:- The client inputs an integer N and creates a
square matrix of order N by populating the matrix with random numbers in the range [1,50].
It then sends the matrix to the server which identifies the matrix type (upper triangular,
lower triangular, diagonal). The server then informs the type (as a string) to the client which
it prints.
6
Client-Server communication using UDP:- You are very good at communicating in the
“new generation” English language with all sorts of abbreviations like tbh, ig, etc. Now
design a client-server application as follows: The client inputs a new-generation English
sentence from the user and sends it to the server. The server then translates the received
sentence to formal English and sends the translated sentence back to the client which it
prints.
Sample string sent to the server
Really idc about this stupid server as it is of no use irl but atm, I will design one, tbf to the
professor.
Translated string sent back to the client
Really I don't care about this stupid server as it is of no use in real life but at the moment, I
will design one, to be fair to the professor.
You may consider only the following abbreviations: tbh, ig, tbf, atm, irl, lol, asap, omg, ttyl,
idk, nvm
7 Implement a multi-user chat server using TCP as the transport layer protocol.
8
Implement a concurrent Time Server application using UDP to execute the program at a
remote server. The client sends a time request to the server which sends its system time
back. The client then displays the received time value.
9
Develop a concurrent file server that will provide the file requested by the client if it exists.
If not, the server sends an appropriate message to the client. The server should also send its
process ID (PID) to clients for displaying along with the file contents or with the message.
10 Develop a packet-capturing application using raw sockets.
Cisco’s Packet tracer based
11
Familiarizing router commands
(a) Knowing the current mode (user or privileged), switching to privileged mode
(b) Switching to configuration mode
(c) Obtaining router information such as type, OS, memory stats, interface details etc.
(d) Viewing the status of any routing protocols currently configured
(e) Showing the routing table
(f) Saving the running configuration
(g) Viewing the command history
(h) Viewing the router clock
(i) Viewing the list of hosts
(j) Displaying the statistics for all the interfaces (Both detailed and brief views)
(k) Knowing the controller type (DTE or DCE)
(l) Configuring serial and ethernet interfaces - enabling the interface, setting IP
address, mask, and clock rate
Figure 1: A sample network along with the interface addresses (all interfaces use a /24 mask)
12 Set up static routing for the network shown in Figure 1. Once the routes are set up, display

Students may select a suitable real world scenario and perform data analysis using appropriate tools. A
few sample topics are given below.
1. Develop a system to analyse social media posts for sentiment and detect trends over time. The
system will gather posts from various social media platforms, analyse the sentiment of these
posts, and identify trending topics or keywords. The insights gained can be used for market
research, brand monitoring, or understanding public opinion.
2. Develop a system to detect and analyse topics from social media posts. The system will collect
posts related to specific keywords or hashtags, perform topic modelling to identify and
categorize main discussion themes, and visualize topic trends over time.
3. Develop a system to analyse and mine data from student marks to uncover patterns, trends, and
insights related to academic performance. The system will process historical student
performance data to identify factors influencing grades, detect patterns in performance, and
provide predictive analytics to assist in improving student outcomes.

Spectral Graph Theory - Introduction to Spectral Graph Theory, Graph
Laplacians: Definition and Properties, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of
Laplacian matrices, Cheeger’s Inequality, Graph Partitioning.
Assignments:
1. Implement Cheeger’s inequality for a set of sample graphs. Compare
the theoretical results with empirical data to analyze the effectiveness
of different partitioning algorithms. Use a set of sample graphs such as
Erdős-Rényi Random Graphs, Barabási-Albert Model: Known for
scale-free properties, and Regular Graphs. Compare theoretical results
with empirical data using different partitioning algorithms such as
Spectral Clustering - Uses the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix, K-
means Clustering - Applied to spectral embeddings of the graph,
Normalized Cut - Minimizes the normalized cut criterion. Measure
how close the empirical conductance is to the theoretical lower bound
provided by Cheeger's inequality. Analyze which algorithms produce
cuts with conductance values closer to the theoretical bounds.
9
Real-world Application: Apply Cheeger's inequality to social network
analysis to detect community structures.
2. Analyze the properties of the Laplacian matrix of a given graph
(Erdős-Rényi Random Graphs). Compute its eigenvalues and
eigenvectors and discuss the implications for graph partitioning.
Examine the use of graph Laplacians in network community detection.

Spectral Clustering - Introduction to Clustering and Spectral Clustering,
Normalized Cut, Eigenvalue Techniques for Clustering, Spectral Clustering
Algorithm, Applications of Spectral Clustering.
Assignment:
1. Implement a spectral clustering algorithm and apply it to a real-world
dataset (Iris dataset). After running the spectral clustering algorithm,
evaluate the results using metrics such as Silhouette Score and
Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). Plot the data points colored by their
cluster assignments to visually inspect the clustering.
Compare spectral clustering with other clustering techniques (e.g., k-
means, hierarchical clustering) on the three types of datasets -
Synthetic Data, Real-World Data (Iris Dataset), and High-Dimensional
Data (Text Data (Use TF-IDF features)). Discuss the advantages and
limitations of spectral clustering in different scenarios.
Real-world Application: Use clustering results for anomaly detection
in network security.

Expanders - Introduction to Expander Graphs, Properties and Construction of
Expanders, edge-expanders, vertex-expanders, spectral-expanders, Expander
Mixing Lemma, Random walks on expanders graphs, Applications of
Expander Graphs: Error-Correcting Codes.
Assignments:
1. Study the construction and properties of expander graphs such as
Erdős-Rényi graphs, Ramanujan graphs and Cayley graphs.
Implement algorithms for generating expander graphs and analyze
their properties based on spectral gap and expansion property.
2. Apply expander graphs to error-correcting codes. Design and test
codes based on expanders, and evaluate their performance in terms of
error correction capabilities. Simulate a communication channel with
added noise and measure the performance of the expander code in
correcting errors. Evaluate the BER, code rate, and error correction
9
capability by comparing the number of errors corrected versus the total
number of errors introduced.
4
LP- and SDP-based Approximation Algorithms for NP-Hard Problems - Linear
Programming (LP) Relaxations and their Use in Approximation: Vertex Cover
and Set Cover, Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and its Applications: Max-
Cut Problem.
Assignments:
1. Implement and evaluate LP relaxations for vertex cover and set cover
problems (use Erdős-Rényi Graphs). Compare the results with exact
solutions and analyze the quality of the approximations.
2. Develop and test approximation algorithms for Max-cut problem using
SDP relaxations. Assess the performance and efficiency of your
algorithms on various datasets. To assess the performance and
efficiency of the SDP-based Max-Cut approximation, test the
algorithm on various types of graphs, including: Erdős-Rényi Graphs,
Barabási-Albert Graphs, and Real-world Graphs. Compare the cut
values obtained from the SDP relaxation and rounding with known or
exact solutions if available. For large graphs, use heuristics or bounds
for comparison. Measure the time taken to solve the SDP relaxation
and perform the rounding. This includes the time for solving the SDP
problem and the time for eigen-decomposition.
