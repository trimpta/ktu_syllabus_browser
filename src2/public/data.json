They\nmay either use a standard dataset or build their own, for the purpose of applying machine learning\nalgorithms. Besides, they may make use of various evaluation parameters to measure the efficiency of the\nmethods. A few sample questions are given below.\n\n1. Classification of Handwritten Digits: Classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset\nusing various machine learning algorithms and compare their performance. This will involve pre-\nprocessing the data, applying different classification techniques and using ensemble methods to\nimprove accuracy.\n2. Predicting Student Examination Performance Based on Internal Marks: Develop a real life\ndataset using the historical data of your institution. Use various machine learning algorithms to\nbuild models to predict students’ final examination scores based on their internal assessment\nmarks and evaluate their performance.

Then use the /proc file\n3 system to determine how long this program (in the strict sense, the corresponding process)\nran in user and kernel modes.\n\nCreate a new process using a fork system call. Print the parent and child process IDs. Use\n4 the pstree command to find the process tree for the child process starting from the init\nprocess.\nWrite a program to add two integers (received via the command line) and compile it to an\nexecutable named “myadder”. Now write another program that creates a new process using\n5\na fork system call. Make the child process add two integers by replacing its image with the\n“myadder” image using execvp system call.\nCreate a new process using a fork system call. The child process should print the string\n“PCCSL407” and the parent process should print the string “Operating Systems Lab”.\n6\nUse a wait system call to ensure that the output displayed is “PCCSL407 Operating\nSystems Lab”\nInter-process Communication (https://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/lpg/node7.html)\n(a) Using Pipe – Evaluate the expression √𝑏(cid:2870)−4𝑎𝑐. The first process\nevaluates 𝑏(cid:2870). The second process evaluates 4𝑎𝑐 and sends it to the first\nprocess which evaluates the final expression and displays it.\n(b) Using Message Queue - The first process sends a string to the second\nprocess. The second process reverses the received string and sends it back\nto the first process. The first process compares the original string and the\n7\nreversed string received from the second one and then prints whether the\nstring is a palindrome or not.\n(c) Using Shared Memory - The first process sends three strings to the second\nprocess. The second process concatenates them to a single string (with\nwhitespace being inserted between the two individual strings) and sends it\nback to the first process. The first process prints the concatenated string in\nthe flipped case, that is if the concatenated string is “Hello S4 Students”,\nthe final output should be “hELLO s4 sTUDENTS”\nWrite a multithreaded program that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation for\na list of integers. This program should receive a series of integers on the command line and\nwill then create three separate worker threads. The first thread will determine the mean\n8 value, the second will determine the median and the third will calculate the standard\ndeviation of the integers. The variables representing the mean, median, and standard\ndeviation values will be stored globally. The worker threads will set these values, and the\nparent thread will output the values once the workers have exited.\n\nInput a list of processes, their CPU burst times (integral values), arrival times, and priorities.\nThen simulate FCFS, SRTF, non-preemptive priority (a larger priority number implies a\n9 higher priority), and RR (quantum = 3 units) scheduling algorithms on the process mix,\ndetermining which algorithm results in the minimum average waiting time (over all\nprocesses).\nUse semaphores to solve the readers-writers problem with writers being given priority over\n10\nreaders.\nObtain a (deadlock-free) process mix and simulate the banker’s algorithm to determine a\n11\nsafe execution sequence.\n12 Obtain a process mix and determine if the system is deadlocked.\nImplement the deadlock-free semaphore-based solution for the dining philosopher’s\n13\nproblem.\nSimulate the address translation in the paging scheme as follows: The program receives\nthree command line arguments in the order\n● size of the virtual address space (in megabytes)\n● page size (in kilobytes)\n14\n● a virtual address (in decimal notation)\nThe output should be the physical address corresponding to the virtual address in <frame\nnumber, offset> format. You may assume that the page table is implemented as an array\nindexed by page numbers. (NB: If the page table has no index for the page number\ndetermined from the virtual address, you may just declare a page table miss!)\nSimulate the FIFO, LRU, and optimal page-replacement algorithms as follows: First,\ngenerate a random page-reference string where page numbers range from 0 to 9. Apply the\nrandom page-reference string to each algorithm, and record the number of page faults\n15\nincurred by each algorithm. Assume that demand paging is used. The length of the reference\nstring and the number of page frames (varying from 1 to 7) are to be received as command\nline arguments.\nSimulate the SSTF, LOOK, and CSCAN disk-scheduling algorithms as follows: Your\nprogram will service a disk with 5,000 cylinders numbered 0 to 4,999. The program will\ngenerate a random series of 10 cylinder requests and service them according to each of the\n16\nalgorithms listed earlier. The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head (as\na parameter on the command line) and will report the total number of head movements\nrequired by each algorithm.\n\nCourse Assessment Method\n(CIE: 50 marks, ESE: 50 marks)\nContinuous Internal Evaluation Marks (CIE):\nPreparation/Pre-Lab Work experiments,\nViva and Timely\nInternal\nAttendance Total\ncompletion of Lab Reports / Record Examination\n(Continuous Assessment)\n5 25 20 50\nEnd Semester Examination Marks (ESE):\nProcedure/\nResult with valid\nConduct of experiment/\ninference/ Viva\nPreparatory Execution of work/\nRecord Total\nwork/Design/ troubleshooting/\nQuality of voce\nProgramming\nOutput\nAlgorithm\n10 15 10 10 5 50\n● Submission of Record: Students shall be allowed for the end semester examination only upon\nsubmitting the duly certified record.\n● Endorsement by External Examiner: The external examiner shall endorse the record\nCourse Outcomes (COs)\nAt the end of the course students should be able to:\nBloom’s\nCourse Outcome Knowledge\nLevel (KL)\nCO1 Illustrate the use of various systems calls in Operating Systems.

What is the function of these\nbits in the response message?\n(k) How many question records, answer records, authority records, and additional\nrecords are present in the query message?\n(l) How many question records, answer records, authority records, and additional\nrecords are present in the response message?\nSocket programming based\nClient-Server communication using TCP:- The client inputs an integer N and creates a\nsquare matrix of order N by populating the matrix with random numbers in the range [1,50].\n5 It then sends the matrix to the server which identifies the matrix type (upper triangular,\nlower triangular, diagonal). The server then informs the type (as a string) to the client which\nit prints.\nClient-Server communication using UDP:- You are very good at communicating in the\n“new generation” English language with all sorts of abbreviations like tbh, ig, etc. Now\ndesign a client-server application as follows: The client inputs a new-generation English\nsentence from the user and sends it to the server. The server then translates the received\nsentence to formal English and sends the translated sentence back to the client which it\nprints.\nSample string sent to the server\n6\nReally idc about this stupid server as it is of no use irl but atm, I will design one, tbf to the\nprofessor.\nTranslated string sent back to the client\nReally I don't care about this stupid server as it is of no use in real life but at the moment, I\nwill design one, to be fair to the professor.\nYou may consider only the following abbreviations: tbh, ig, tbf, atm, irl, lol, asap, omg, ttyl,\nidk, nvm\n7 Implement a multi-user chat server using TCP as the transport layer protocol.\nImplement a concurrent Time Server application using UDP to execute the program at a\n8 remote server. The client sends a time request to the server which sends its system time\nback. The client then displays the received time value.\n\nDevelop a concurrent file server that will provide the file requested by the client if it exists.\n9 If not, the server sends an appropriate message to the client. The server should also send its\nprocess ID (PID) to clients for displaying along with the file contents or with the message.\n10 Develop a packet-capturing application using raw sockets.\nCisco’s Packet tracer based\nFamiliarizing router commands\n(a) Knowing the current mode (user or privileged), switching to privileged mode\n(b) Switching to configuration mode\n(c) Obtaining router information such as type, OS, memory stats, interface details etc.\n(d) Viewing the status of any routing protocols currently configured\n(e) Showing the routing table\n(f) Saving the running configuration\n11\n(g) Viewing the command history\n(h) Viewing the router clock\n(i) Viewing the list of hosts\n(j) Displaying the statistics for all the interfaces (Both detailed and brief views)\n(k) Knowing the controller type (DTE or DCE)\n(l) Configuring serial and ethernet interfaces - enabling the interface, setting IP\naddress, mask, and clock rate\n\nFigure 1: A sample network along with the interface addresses (all interfaces use a /24 mask)\nSet up static routing for the network shown in Figure 1.
